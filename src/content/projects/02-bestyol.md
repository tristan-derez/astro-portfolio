### Description

For a school project I had to build the backend for a gamification app. At signup you chose a "Yol" which is a little
creature, as you complete daily tasks you get xp which makes your Yol level up.

_In 4 weeks we built v1:_
>User get 6 random daily tasks per day and can validate them <br>
>User can create custom tasks and validate them <br>
>User can validate success <br>
>User are able to evolve their Yol

_Future plan:_

>Fights between Yol <br>
>Add an option to prevent users from getting tasks from sport category

### Techs
