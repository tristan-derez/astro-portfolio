## BestYol

### Description 

For our end-of-year project, we were assigned the challenge of building an app from the ground up to showcase our skills.

We worked together to create a solution for users having difficulties with managing their daily life tasks,
like doing laundry, taking a walk, reading pages of a bookâ€¦

The goal is to motivate users to progressively cultivate habits that would enhance their daily lives.
To accomplish this, they can register to create a Yol, a cute creature that will be their new pet.

As they complete daily tasks, they gain experience points, and if they keep completing daily tasks, they will get
success too. Both grants additional experience points.
These experience points enable the level up of the Yol, and as it gains XP, it will evolve, up to three
different evolutions.

The app is not limited to preset tasks. Users can also create custom tasks that fit their specific needs and
goals. However, these custom tasks will not give any XP points.

In the future, I'm planning to add a combat system, allowing Yols to engage in friendly battles with
others.

_In 4 weeks we built v1:_
>User get 6 random daily tasks per day and can validate them <br>
>User can create custom tasks and validate them <br>
>User can validate success <br>
>User are able to evolve their Yol
